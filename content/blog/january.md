Recently I joined the Goodreads community and decided to participate in the 2023 Reading Challenge. Exaggerated as I am, I put 48 books on my list, which puts me in an effort to read at least one book per week, during the whole year. Generally, this will never be an issue, since I read a lot, but this year, I  started behind schedule because I spent the month watching movies. 

I don't know, I get excited at the beginning of the year with the season awards coming through (Yeah, I still do care about the Oscars) and I simply cannot think in anything else. 

If you want to know everything that I'm watching (including the bad stuff), you can follow me on TV TIME, where I track everything down and also create some thematic lists, but if you don't have all this free time and wanna see know just the best ones, keep reading this post.

Let's get started!

**New Releases**

Movies that were released quite recently in theaters or streaming.

- Top Gun: Maverick, the colossal return of *Tom Cruise* as Captain Pete Maverick.


- Pinocchio's Guillermo Del Toro, the unexpected and most beautiful adaptation of *Carlo Collodi's* book.

**Never get tired**

Movies I've watched more than once.
