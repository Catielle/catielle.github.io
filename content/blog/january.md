I recently joined the Goodreads community and I decided to participate in the 2023 Reading Challenge. As exaggerated as I am, I put 48 books on my list, which puts me on a effort to read at least one book per week, during the whole year. Generally, this will never be an issue, since I read a lot, but this year, I just started behind schedule because I spent my month watching movies. 

I don't know, I get excited in the begginig of the year with the season awards coming through (Yeah, I still do care about the Oscars) and I simply cannot think in anything else. 

If you want to know everything that I'm watching (including the bad stuff),  you can follow me on TV TIME, but if you don't have all this free time and wanna know just the best ones,  just keep reading this post.
