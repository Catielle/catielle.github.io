Iâ€™m a Storyteller who works as a Ghostwriter. In the past ten years I've been dealing with the joy and responsibility to create stories and narratives that uplift, inspire, inform and shape the way we see ourselves and the world around us. Now, I'm studying Screenwriting to master the rules of drama and conduct my career to the next level.

Feel free to connect and let me know if I can help you to create your story. We can get it done together!
